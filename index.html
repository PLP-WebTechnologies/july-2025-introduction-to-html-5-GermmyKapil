      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The Power Learn Project (PLP) has been a game-changing experience in my tech journey. As part of the 16-week Software Development Engineering program, I’ve been diving deep into the world of code, logic, and real-world problem-solving.</p>

      <h2>What I Learned Just In This Two-First-Week</h2>
      <article>
        <h3>HTML5 & Web Foundations</h3>
        <p>I started by mastering the basics: semantic HTML5, structuring clean web pages, and understanding the importance of accessibility. It’s not just about writing code—it’s about writing code *that works for everyone*.</p>

        <h3>Git, GitHub & Collaboration</h3>
        <p>Version control was a beast at first, but learning to use Git and GitHub gave me the tools to collaborate and contribute like a true developer. From cloning to merging, every command taught me something new.</p>

      <article>
        <h3>Hackathons & Real Projects</h3>
        <p>Hackathon Week pushed me out of my comfort zone. Building a personal portfolio using only HTML and CSS taught me the value of fast execution, clear code, and working under pressure.</p>

    <section id="growth">
      <h2>Personal Growth</h2>
      <p>Beyond the technical knowledge, PLP helped me grow in confidence, resilience, and discipline. I learned how to break big problems into manageable tasks, communicate better, and trust my process—even when the bugs hit hard.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="future">
      <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
      <p>This is just the beginning. I’m excited to dig deeper into front-end and back-end development, build solutions for African communities, and keep learning with the amazing PLP network. The future is full-stack, and I’m here for it.</p>
